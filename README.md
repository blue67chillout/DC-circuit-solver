# DC-circuit-solver

Built a circuit solver to find branch current and voltages in pure resistive circuits with independent voltage and current
sources .
The program takes the netlist of the circuit design and provides the current and voltage information as output on an
algorithm based out of Modifiesd Nodal Analysis.
